**About the figure above**: Multiple shapes generated using PISTL as STL file and visualized in **Meshmixer** for the purpose of this picture. The visualization in PISTL can be done using pyvista, which is installed as a dependency.

## What is PISTL?

PISTL is a library that can be used in python to programatically create stereolithographic (stl) files of regular geometric shapes like circle, cylinder, tetrahedron, sphere, pyramid and others by morphing these shapes. pystl also provide functions that can be used to translate and rotate these stl objects.

In summary:
PISTL can be used for the following purposes:

- to create simple geometric shape files in .stl format.
- visualize this stl files. [PySTL uses pyvista for such visualizations].
- perform simple transformations like translate, rotate and scale shapes.

### Examples
